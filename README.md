Tools for making [OPTIMADE APIs](https://optimade.org) from various formats of structural data (e.g. an archive of CIF files).

This repository contains the src/optimade-maker Python package and the corresponding CLI tool optimake, which together provide this functionality. Features include

- definition of a config file format (`optimade.yaml`) for annotating data archives to be used in the OPTIMADE ecosystem;
- conversion of the raw data into corresponding OPTIMADE types using pre-existing parsers (e.g., ASE for structures);
- conversion of the annotated data archive into the OPTIMADE JSON Lines file format ([spec](https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/OPTIMADE/blob/develop/optimade.rst#the-optimade-json-lines-format-for-database-exchange)) that can be ingested into a database and used to serve a full OPTIMADE API.
- serving either an annotated data archive or a JSON Lines file as an OPTIMADE API (using the [`optimade-python-tools`](https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/optimade-python-tools/)
  reference server implementation).

## Usage

See `./examples` for a more complete set of supported formats and corresponding `optimade.yaml` config files.

### Annotating with `optimade.yaml`

To annotate your structural data for `optimade-maker`, the data archive needs to be accompanied by an `optimade.yaml` config file. The following is a simple example for a zip archive (`structures.zip`) of cif files together with an optional property file (`data.csv`):

```yaml
config_version: 0.1.1
database_description: Simple database

entries:
  - entry_type: structures
    entry_paths:
      - file: structures.zip
        matches:
          - cifs/*/*.cif
    # (optional) property file and definitions:
    property_paths:
      - file: data.csv
    property_definitions:
      - name: energy
        title: Total energy per atom
        description: DFT total energy per atom
        unit: eV/atom
        type: float
```

### Structure `id`s and property files

`optimade-maker` will assign an `id` for each structure based on its full path in the archive, following a simple deterministic rule: from the set of all archive paths, the maximum common path prefix and postfix (including file extensions) are removed. E.g.

```
structures.zip/cifs/set1/101.cif
structures.zip/cifs/set2/102.cif
```

produces `["set1/101", "set2/102"]`.

The property files need to either refer to these `id`s or the full path in the archive to be associated with a structure. E.g. a possible property `csv` file could be

```csv
id,energy
set1/101,2.5
structures.zip/cifs/set2/102.cif,3.2
```

### Installing and running `optimake`

Install with

```bash
pip install optimade-maker
```

this will also make the `optimake` CLI utility available.

For a folder containing the data archive and the `optimade.yaml` file (such as in `/examples`), run

- `optimake convert .` to just convert the entry into the JSONL format (see below).
- `optimake serve .` to start the OPTIMADE API (this also first converts the entry, if needed);

For more detailed information see also `optimake --help`.
